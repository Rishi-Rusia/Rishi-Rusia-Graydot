INSTRUCTIONS: 

1. Open your web browser.

2. Enter the file path of the index.html page where the drag and drop application folder is situated.

3. The web page will load, displaying two containers side by side. The left container will have a list of items, and the right container will be empty initially.

4. To drag an item from the left container, move your mouse cursor over the item you want to drag.

5. Click and hold the mouse button on the item.

6. While holding the mouse button, move your cursor to the right container.

7. As you move the item over the right container, you will notice a visual change in the appearance of the dragged item, indicating that it can be dropped.

8. Position the item where you want it to be dropped within the right container.

9. Release the mouse button to drop the item into the right container.

10. Once the item is dropped, it will appear in the right container at the chosen position.

11. If the drop is successful, a success message will be displayed momentarily below the right container, confirming the item has been dropped.

12. To reset the containers and start over, locate the "Reset" button on the web page.

13. Click the "Reset" button to clear the right container and return all the items back to the left container.

14. Repeat the dragging and dropping process as desired, dragging different items or rearranging the items within the right container.

15. When you are done using the application, close the web browser or navigate away from the web page.

By following these steps, you can effectively use the drag and drop application to move items between the containers and reset them as needed.
